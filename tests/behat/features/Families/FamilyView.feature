Feature: Family View
  In order to view a family's details
  As a User
  I am able to load the family view page for the family

  Scenario: Family Not Found
    Given I am authenticated as "admin" using "changeme"
    And I am on "/v2/family/not-found?id=9999"
    Then I should see "Oops! FAMILY 9999 Not Found"
